# jpeg-decoder
A jpeg decoder originally made to solve a [Kattis problem](https://open.kattis.com/problems/coincounter).

The `test` program prints out the supplied image using spaces colored with [ANSI 24-bit color escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#24-bit).

The examples are my own images. [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) was used to scale and remove chroma subsampling from the `no_subsampling` examples. [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) was used otherwise.

## Currently Supported
* Baseline DCT

## Usage
```bash
# setup
make

# print image
./bin/test <file>
```
